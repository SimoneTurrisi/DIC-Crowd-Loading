# DIC-Crowd-Loading
 Run Digital Image Correlation (DIC) to estimate the vertical motion and the inertial load of a jumping
 crowd.  The programs are implemented in MATLAB and make use of the tool 'Digital Image Correlation Engine (DICe)' 
as external module to run the analysis. For more info about DICe see https://github.com/dicengine.   

- Folder '_dice-master_' contains the DICe tool, available from https://github.com/dicengine/dice; 

- Folder '_RunDIC_' contains the MATLAB programs to run DIC analysis (see file 'Instructions.txt' for more info).
